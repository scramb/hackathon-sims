        input: Update: Water Ingress Screening and Shipping Loose Crystalline - from now on - Ochsenfurt Plant

        Hello everyone

        we can give you the following update:
        The inspection and assessment of the damage has been completed and we can give the all-clear.
        The cleaning work will continue for some time and operations will be resumed.

        We expect that sugar will be available again in about 2 hours and that loading can be resumed in the loose crystalline area.
        The customer deliveries scheduled for tomorrow can thus be loaded.

        We would set the resumption of the WZ2 transfers for about 5 p.m. (so that sufficient sugar is available again).

        output: plant: Ochsenfurt,
        update: resume Shipping Loose Crystalline,
        reason: inspection of the damage complete,
        period: tomorrow,

        input: UPDATE: still limited capacity after robot conversion

        Hello everyone

        unfortunately, the robot still does not run stably.
        The production lines in the fondant area are therefore running with a limited production capacity of up to approx. 75%.
        These restrictions will remain in place until the optimisation measures take effect.

        Longer lead times for fondant products are still to be expected. 
        Please continue to contact the ZWV masters directly for product inquiries.
